## 🔒 **PROTECTION STRATEGY**

### **✅ Admin Pages Protected:**
```
Location: src/app/admin/*
Protection: 
  - Separate folder structure
  - Will not be affected by team/public changes
  - Admin-specific routes
  - Admin-only components
```

### **📍 Team Pages (To Be Created):**
```
Location: src/app/team/*
Protection:
  - Separate folder from admin
  - Team-specific routes
  - Team-specific components
  - Will not affect admin pages
```

### **📍 Public Pages (To Be Created):**
```
Location: src/app/public/*
Protection:
  - Separate folder from admin & team
  - Public-specific routes
  - Public-specific components
  - Will not affect admin or team pages
```

## 📝 **NEXT STEPS FOR TEAM/PUBLIC**

### **For Team Pages:**
```
1. Create src/app/team/layout.tsx
2. Create src/app/team/page.tsx (redirect to dashboard)
3. Create src/app/team/dashboard/page.tsx
4. Update NavLinks.tsx team menu to use /team/* routes
5. Add role-based access control
6. Customize features (no delete, limited access)
```

### **For Public Pages:**
```
1. Create src/app/public/layout.tsx
2. Create src/app/public/page.tsx (redirect to dashboard)
3. Create src/app/public/dashboard/page.tsx
4. Update NavLinks.tsx public menu to use /public/* routes
5. Add guest-friendly features
6. Certificate verification only
```

## ✅ **ADMIN PAGES SAFE**

**Guarantee:**
- ✅ Admin pages in separate `/admin` folder
- ✅ Team pages will be in separate `/team` folder
- ✅ Public pages will be in separate `/public` folder
- ✅ No overlap or conflicts
- ✅ Each role has isolated routes
- ✅ Modifications to team/public will NOT affect admin

**Current Working Admin URLs:**
```
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin/templates
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin/members
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin/categories
✅ http://localhost:3000/certificates (shared, but admin has full access)
```

**Team/Public URLs (After Creation):**
```
📍 http://localhost:3000/team
📍 http://localhost:3000/team/dashboard
📍 http://localhost:3000/public
📍 http://localhost:3000/public/dashboard
```
